# üõ°Ô∏è Gots - Go TLS Library

Gots is a Go library for generating self-signed TLS certificates and managing TLS connections. It simplifies the process of handling TLS certificates, especially for development and testing purposes.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Certificate Generation:** Easily generate self-signed TLS certificates with a simple function call.
- **Key Pair Creation:** Create private key and public key pairs for secure communication.
- **Certificate Storage:** Save generated certificates and keys to specified directories.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Customize certificate and key file names and output directories as per your needs.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling for smooth troubleshooting and debugging.


## üîß Usage

Here's an example of how you can utilize Gots to generate self-signed TLS certificates and set up an HTTPS server:

1. **Import Gots: Import Gots into your Go project:**

   ```bash
   import (
        "fmt"
        "net/http"

        "github.com/sprdgx/gots"
    )

2. **Generate TLS Certificate: Generate a self-signed TLS certificate and private key:**
   
   ```bash
    certPath := "certs/certificate.pem"
    keyPath := "certs/private_key.pem"
    rootCACertPath := "certs/root_ca.crt"

    err := gots.GenerateAndSaveCert(certPath, keyPath, rootCACertPath)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error generating or saving certificate:", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Println("Certificate and Private Key generation completed successfully.")
    fmt.Println("Root CA Certificate exported to:", rootCACertPath)
   
3. **Set Up HTTPS Server: Create an HTTPS server using the generated certificate and private key:**

   ```bash
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprint(w, "Hi, welcome to HTTPS!")
    })

    fmt.Println("HTTPS Server running on port 9999")
    err := http.ListenAndServeTLS(":9999", certPath, keyPath, nil)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error starting HTTPS server:", err)
    }

## ü§î Why Use Gots? 

  **Simplicity:**
    Easily generate self-signed TLS certificates without complex configurations.

  **Convenience:**
    Simplify TLS certificate management for development and testing purposes.

  **Flexibility:** 
    Integrate TLS functionality seamlessly into Go applications.
